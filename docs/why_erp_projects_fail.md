# Why ERP Projects Fail? (and How to Prevent It)

I have led and been part of ERP implementations 4 times 🙄 

After seeing too many ERP implementation programs burn time, money, and credibility, I have observed the 10 most common reasons ERP projects crash — and what I think are the simple fixes.

## 1) Problem: Poor planning
😇 **Solution:** Define clear business objectives, a realistic roadmap, and ROI before selecting the ERP.

## 2) Problem: Inadequate training
😇 **Solution:** Deliver role-based, hands-on training that continues well after go-live.

## 3) Problem: Resistance to change
😇 **Solution:** Explain why the change matters and how it improves people’s daily work.

## 4) Problem: Unrealistic expectations
😇 **Solution:** Position ERP as a phased business transformation, not an IT magic button.

## 5) Problem: Lack of executive support
😇 **Solution:** Ensure leaders actively sponsor the program and free up top talent.

## 6) Problem: Poor data quality
😇 **Solution:** Clean and standardize master data before migration — not during crisis mode.

## 7) Problem: Inadequate resources
😇 **Solution:** Assign dedicated, skilled resources and protect them from day-to-day firefighting.

## 8) Problem: Poor communication
😇 **Solution:** Run a structured communication cadence with clear ownership and transparency.

## 9) Problem: Misalignment with business goals
😇 **Solution:** Configure ERP around business outcomes, not shiny system features.

## 10) Problem: Weak change management
😇 **Solution:** Treat change management as a core workstream — people decide ERP success.

### 💢 Bottom line:
ERP failures are rarely about software. They’re about people, process, data, and leadership.

If you’re planning an ERP journey (or recovering from one), start here — it’ll save you years of pain.
